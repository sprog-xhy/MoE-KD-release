Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.", "output": "Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743[a] \u2013 July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809.[13] Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.\n\nAmong the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth.[14] His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries.[15] He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nJefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.\n\nJefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism,[4] and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800.[16] Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment.\n\nSince the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.[17][18][19]\n\nAfter retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery.

It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]\n\nMembers of the movement saw themselves as a progressive \u00e9lite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.[1]\n\nThis intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumi\u00e8res movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of \"enlightenment\" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.\n\nIn the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. \nA link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. \nHowever, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.\n\nFurthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing.

{"topic": "brainstorming", "instruction": "Give me five ways in which I can make my homebrew beer more interesting", "input": "", "output": "There are infinite ways to create interesting flavours, that are either personal favourites or attempt to replicate classic beers and beer styles. There are a number of factors that make up a beers flavour profile and part of the enjoyment brewing your own beer at home, is that you can play around with each of these to change the flavour and character of your homebrew beer. Here are five ways in which you can change your own homebrew recipe to add interesting flavours or alternatively you can alter an existing homebrew recipe shared by somebody else or a brewery.\n\n1. Use different hops\nThere is a huge variety of hops available to homebrewers and each of these can introduce its own particular flavour and aroma to your beer, ranging from pineapple and apricots, to pine trees and woods, to grapefruit pith and lemon zest. By using a different hop in your recipe either from the same family or from an entirely different family of hops, you can easily add interesting and often radical changes to the flavour profile of your beer. However, depending on when the hops are added in the brewing process, you can also increase/decrease the levels of bitterness of your beer, due to different hop varieties having different levels of alpha acids.\n\n2. Use a different yeast\nBesides fermenting the beer, yeast leave behind lots of interesting flavours and can give your homebrew it's own subtle character. For example, English yeast strains can add malty and sweet flavours, California yeast tends to create a clean and crisp beer, whilst saison yeast adds bright and fruity flavours to your beer.\n\n3. Use different grains\nChanging the amount of base malts can increase or decrease the alcohol in your finished beer. Trying swapping one base malt for another, like American pale malts for a British variety, and look for the subtle differences between them. You can also play around with the specialty grains, like using a slightly darker roast.\n\n4. Add fruit, spices or herbs\nFruits, spices, herbs, and other ingredients are a great way to add an entirely personal character to your homebrew. Anything from fresh strawberries and basil to vanilla beans and cardamom can really complement the other malty, hoppy flavours in a beer. \n\n5. Alter your water profile\nDifferent beer styles will typically be best achieved with a suitable water profile, with different levels of minerals to achieve the desired flavour profile. By adjusting the amounts of specific minerals found in your brewing water, beer can be made to taste fuller bodied, sweeter, drier, more bitter, or even sour.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the human hearing range.[2]\n\nHigh fidelity contrasts with the lower-quality \u201clo-fi\u201d sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, AM radio, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.", "output": "Bell Laboratories began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s. Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra\u2014that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound. After World War II, Harry F. Olson conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high-fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.[citation needed]\n\nBeginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made major improvements of home-audio quality possible:\n\nReel-to-reel audio tape recording, based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as Bing Crosby make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.\nThe advent of the 33\u2153 rpm Long Play (LP) microgroove vinyl record, with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified equalization curves as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. Classical music fans, who were opinion leaders in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.\nHigher quality turntables, with more responsive needles\nFM radio, with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than AM radio.\nBetter amplifier designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible distortion.[3]\nNew loudspeaker designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by Edgar Villchur and Henry Kloss with improved bass frequency response.\nIn the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase high fidelity as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. Many consumers found the difference in quality compared to the then-standard AM radios and 78-rpm records readily apparent and bought high-fidelity phonographs and 33\u2153 LPs such as RCA's New Orthophonics and London's FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK Decca system). Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, preamplifiers, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. With the advent of integrated multi-speaker console systems in the 1950s, hi-fi became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing phonograph and record player.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of stereophonic equipment and recordings led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the \"Golden Age of Hi-Fi\", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered superior by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (transistorized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.\n\nIn the 1960s, the FTC with the help of the audio manufacturers came up with a definition to identify high fidelity equipment so that the manufacturers could clearly state if they meet the requirements and reduce misleading advertisements.[4]\n\nThe metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974.[5] In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems.[5] Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available.[6] Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.[7]\n\nA popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated music centre\u2014which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction.\n\nAudiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers, and other components.\n\nListening tests\nSee also: Codec listening test\nListening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines, and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid-state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which listeners cannot see the components being tested. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent,[8] a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.\n\nBlind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these blind tests is not accepted by some audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound in their evaluations of audio equipment. John Atkinson, current editor of Stereophile, stated that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that \"the magic was gone\" until he replaced it with a tube amp.[9] Robert Harley of The Absolute Sound wrote, in 2008, that: \"...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.\"[10]\n\nDoug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009.[11][12] He stated: \"Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so.\" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB, and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers.

Unfortunately, this outing was foiled by the constant downpour of rain so Lisa resigned herself to a day inside with the tiny tyrant. Stella arrived early and excited to play.  Lisa decided to begin with a game of hide and seek, after all this could take up a good part of the morning without too much trouble.

Eventually she set off to find the little girl but soon she realized that something was wrong.  No matter where she looked, Stella was nowhere to be found. The house wasn't that large, making her disappearance even more perplexing.

Panic was starting to settle in as she moved the wardrobe further from the wall, where only a small child could have hidden before.  Suddenly, saw a small crack in the wall, and then realized it was a small door that she never knew was there.  The door was slightly ajar and she eventually moved the wardrobe enough to open the door and climb inside. What was this place?  The entrance opened up to reveal a small room that Lisa never knew existed!  It was full of treasure, gold bars and jewels.  Stella sat in the middle of the room quietly playing with the treasure, unaware of the immense value she was surrounded by.  Lisa had known her aunt was a secretive woman but this was an incredible find and would change her life forever.  Stella's visit was the good luck charm she needed to unlock this bounty and she would be forever grateful to the little girl!

Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  \n\nThis mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.\n\nSo then why Georgia?

{"topic": "general_qa", "instruction": "As a golfer, how can I fix my slice?", "input": "", "output": "A common swing fault in golfers is a slice which is caused when the face of the club isn't aligned properly to the swing path of the club.  What will typically happen is at the time of impact, the face is open in relation to the target (ie aimed to the right if you are a right handed golfer) and the swing path is closed in relation to the target (ie aimed to the left if you are a left handed golfer).  When there is a large difference between the path of the swing and the face of the club, the impact will generate a high degree of lateral spin on the ball causing the flight of the ball to curve away from the target.  Here are some ways to fix this swing fault:\n\n1. Grip the club with a stronger grip.  This means the v formed between your thumb and pointer finger on back hand is pointed to your rear shoulder and your opposite hand it also gripping the club more from the back.  This will help you close the face of the club at impact.\n2. Focus on keeping the face closed in the backswing.  One fault many amateurs have is the club face opens toward the sky on the backswing too far meaning that the face will need to turn more on the downswing to get to square at impact.  Creating less rotation on the backswing can help with this.  \n3. Keeping hips down and back in the downswing.  One fault that can cause inconsistent contact as well as a slice is when the hips thrust forward during the downswing causing the golfer to lift up to counter being too close to the ball which can often cause an over the top, out-to-in swing path.  Try to keep the hips back through the swing and focus on rotating the body to keep forward or lateral movement to a minimum.  \n\nA slice is a very common issue among golfers but knowing the causes and swing faults that lead to a slice can help you think about how you can improve your swing to fix it.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

{"topic": "creative_writing", "instruction": "What is more important in society, freedom or safety?", "input": "", "output": "In our society, freedom and safety are both valued. While many other countries may put safety first, the harsh reality for Americans is that freedom always comes before safety. Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.\nThe 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.\nOften a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?\nOn the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.\nTo be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

{"topic": "creative_writing", "instruction": "Explain how new technologies, like LLMs and ChatGPT, may revolutionize Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in the future. Provide an example of how these APIs might work.", "input": "", "output": "As a kid, I loved watching the Jetsons. As I grew older and ended up writing software and creating & implementing architectures for systems, I thought I would never see the day when a Jetsons-like kitchen would be feasible.\nGPT (ChatGPT, etc.) has changed my mind.\n\nContractual Obligations\nAs an architect, you kind of need to think like a lawyer. You define contracts (APIs) between systems or components. You monitor those APIs for abuse or misuse.\n\nI would use Swagger editor to define those contracts, and I would write the APIs to match interactions implied in mock-ups. I would vet the design with the team, I would walk through scenarios to see if the API would fit the use case and would not introduce performance bottlenecks, and I would simulate and automate as much as I could along the journey.\n\nI was very careful to get it right the first time. It was never perfect the first time, of course. So, I also had to consider how the API could evolve while minimizing costs/impact to the rest of the system. The API, once deployed, would become something I would guard, like an honest politician guards the #usconstitution. The team had to be careful with any change that impacted the API.\n\nAPI Mesh... More like API mess!\nAPIs rely on APIs which rely on more APIs and libraries. Once a system gets large enough, that complexity becomes a bottleneck. Small changes can have a huge ripple effect. Some approaches (like federated #GraphQL) help manage this complexity nicely. But it still involves an API under which there can exist a lot of fragility. #Agile or not, developing a complicated web of APIs is complex, requires specialized skills, and is full of unforeseen challenges.\n\nThe Kitchen Conversation, ChatGPT-style\nThe Jetsons' kitchen involves a number of systems, each composed of various parts, sensors, hardware, inputs and outputs. Considering the complexity of interactions between independent systems in a kitchen, the fact that the Jetsons' kitchen components would come from various vendors or manufacturers, traditional API design would not be able to fulfill the vision. Not practical, at all.\n\nNow, let's think about APIs and the Jetsons' kitchen, #chatgpt -style.\n\nLet's keep it simple: pizza. You (or your robot) make a pizza from scratch.\n\nThe oven asks the refrigerator: \"I see we have a pizza. Can you tell me if this is low-moisture mozzarella?\"\n\nRefrigerator: \"That's not even mozzarella. This pizza must have Muenster cheese as that is all I had in me. And the human removed some of the contents 30 minutes ago, so the probability of Muenster cheese on that pizza is quite high.\"\n\nA sensor from the kitchen who has eyes across the room chimes in at this point. Sensor: \"Beware that the crust of this pizza is made of cauliflower. I agree with the video sensor's assessment regarding the type of cheese. No new cheese entered the kitchen recently.\"\n\nOven: \"Anything else I should know?\"\n\nSensor: \"The temperature of the dough is 47F. This is cooler than the expert chef consensus of using room-temperature dough.\"\n\nOven: \"Great. I know what to do. Since the dough is cool, I will start cooking with a temperature a little lower than the recipe specifies. Then I will increase the temp of bottom element so as to provide a nice crisp crust. I will keep a close eye on moisture and may use convection to mitigate any undesirable levels of moisture.\"\n\nWhere is the API that contractually binds the independent systems? APIs are not gone. For instance, the brain of the Oven will have myriad APIs (e.g. for interacting with temperature controllers and sensors, etc.). The key here is that the interface between systems is no longer a fixed, rigid API. No method signatures, no paths, no payload specifications. Instead, a conversation relating to senses and capabilities.\n\nWhat \"brain\"?\nKence Anderson's book Designing Autonomous AI describes nicely how a complex system can be decomposed into a number of independent \"brains.\" Each brain, in his book, can be independently developed and refined, with human guidance married with #datascience, #machinelearning and #dataengineering.\n\nWhat's Cookin'?\nI am excited for what the future holds. How architects rethink complex system design with regards to APIs is, in my opinion, something that is inevitable. And, as an amateur pizza maker, my taste buds are watering for the day I get some GPT help to make an even better #detroitpizza.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

{"topic": "general_qa", "instruction": "Who is the best men's test cricket player to have come from New Zealand?", "input": "", "output": "Despite a rich cricket tradition in New Zealand, the country only became a test playing nation during the season of 1929/30, when the MCC toured the country playing 4 tests. Australia, the nearest test playing country to New Zealand, refused to grant Test status to any games played between the two nations until well after World War 2. This lack of test opportunities led to a now common path of talented New Zealanders moving off shore for the chance to play test cricket- most notably in the pre WWII period of Clarrie Grimmet, who took over 200 test wickets playing for Australia. Since then, Andrew Caddick (234 test wickets at an average of 29.91) and Ben Stokes (5000+ test runs and 196 test wickets) have played leading roles for England in tests.\n\nIf however we define the question as \"the best test cricket player to have played for New Zealand\", then there are perhaps only 3 or 4 candidates that feature. Of the current generation, there is no doubt that Kane Williamson will one day be regarded as the greatest player to have come from New Zealand- with over 8000 test runs at an average north of 50. With many years in front of him, Williamson will no doubt hold the crown of best test cricketer in years to come. \n\nMartin Crowe must likewise be regarded in the pantheon of test greats to have played for New Zealand- despite a slow start to his career, and injuries curtailing his time in the team, he amassed over 5000 runs at an average of over 45.\n\nHowever, most will agree that the most influential cricketer ever to play test cricket for New Zealand was Sir Richard Hadlee- the first cricketer to be knighted whilst still playing cricket for his country. Hadlee's bowling average of 22.29 is one of best in test cricket history, and at the time of his retirement he held the record for test wickets, at 431. Gaining 5 wickets in an innings 36 times was also a record, and led New Zealand to some of it's most famous test victories, notably victory in a series in Australia for the first time in 1985/86, with his best test figures of 15 for 123 coming in the first test at the Gabba. Added to his bowling, his destructive lower order batting made his one of the preeminent all rounders of the game., and truly NZ's best test cricketer.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

It is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. The country is sparsely inhabited, with the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nCanada is a parliamentary liberal democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\nA highly developed country, Canada has one of the highest nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, G7, Group of Ten, G20, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), Commonwealth of Nations, Arctic Council, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and Organization of American States.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

In lead climbing the rope begins at the bottom attached to the climber as well as the belayer. The climber must then bring the rope from the bottom of the route to the top by clipping into a series of quick draws that are generally placed 10-15 feet apart. If a person were to fall while lead climbing, they would be caught by the last quick draw they clipped into. When top rope climbing, the rope is already at the top of the route. This means the climber must tie into one side of the rope while their belayer must clip into the other side of the rope. As the climber ascends higher up the route the belayer must take out the slack of the rope as opposed to lead climbing where the belayer would be giving slack. When a person falls in top rope climbing they will only fall a short distance as the rope is already clipped in above them at the top of the route, so how far they fall will be determined by how much slack the belayer has not taken in.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.[16][17]", "output": "After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.\n\nIn 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.[5][6]\n\nOnyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.[7][8]\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[9] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.[10]\n\nIn 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System.[11] This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.\n\nIn 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.[12]\n\nThese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own.[13][14]", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

{"topic": "creative_writing", "instruction": "Can I make chocolate at home?", "input": "", "output": "Making chocolate at home can be rewarding, but be prepared to spend a little money and a lot of time. The money goes to equipment and cocoa beans. For equipment, you will need a melanger (about $600)  to grind the beans and a tempering machine (about $400) to make the finished product. You will also need a silicone mat (about $20) and a hair dryer (about $30). But let's start at the beginning.\n\nBuy between two and six pounds of fermented raw cocoa beans. There are a variety of retail importers you can find on the web. Choose a single variety or a blend that appeals to your taste in chocolate.\n\nSort the beans, removing broken beans, badly misshapen beans, and whatever foreign bodies may be present.\n\nRoast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!\n\nLet the beans cool.\n\nPeel the beans. You can do this by hand - which I find produces a superior product - but be warned that this can take up to 6 hours per pound. Alternatively, you can purchase a winnower and use the hair dryer to blow out the skins. This approach is much faster, but leaves more skin and loses more bean fragments. Either way, weigh your final bean yield.\n\nGet you melanger going. Use the hair dryer to get the grinding surfaces up to at least 120F. Add the beans a handful at a time. Help the melanger along if it gets stuck. Make sure the melanger is going steadily before leaving it unattended. When it gets going, it will flow well.\n\nRun the melanger for 24 to 72 hours, again depending on your experience with the beans and your tastes. If trying a mix of beans, add the more robustly flavored beans early in the process and the more delicately flavored beans later. Give even the most delicate beans at least 8 hours. Add sugar to taste. The percentage of sugar by weight can vary from a few percent up to 30 percent. You may also add dried whole fat milk at this point, and other flavorings, like an inch or so of vanilla bean. Melange the sugar and other additives at least 8 more hours. The goal is to decrease the particle size below what can be detected by the  tongue. When done, decant into a silicone mat line baking pan. This is your untempered chocolate. it melts easily and tends to get crumbly as it ages. Which is why you will want to temper it.\n\nFinally, follow the directions on your tempering machine, adding chunks of untempered chocolate as indicated. The liquid tempered chocolate can be used for fruit dipping or can be poured into molds for bars or shaped candies. Other additives can be included at this stage - nuts, nougat etc. Cool the results at room temperature for several hours before serving. Enjoy the results of your labor.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

{"topic": "general_qa", "instruction": "What is Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India", "input": "", "output": "The Unified Payments Interface is a Peer to Peer payments system launched in India by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. NPCI set out with a mandate to change the face of India\u2019s payment systems. It developed the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as an architecture framework with a set of standard Application Programming Interface (API) specifications to facilitate online payments. The aim was to simplify and provide a single interface across all NPCI systems, thereby creating interoperability and a superior customer experience.\n\nUPI is now one of the most preferred payment solutions in India, with over a billion transactions every month. FY22, the total transaction value processed by the United Payments Interface (UPI) platform accounted for 86% of India\u2019s GDP. UPI\u2019s core function is to support easy and secure money transfers between bank accounts. It does this by adding multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, allowing for seamless fund transfers and merchant payments from one place. It also enables \u2018peer to peer\u2019 and \u2018peer to merchant\u2019 collection requests, which can be scheduled and paid as requested.\n\nPayments can be made using a UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and an Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). Payment security is as per applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines using a 1-click 2-factor authentication where the second factor of authentication is the UPI PIN. \n\nUPI can be accessed on all major platforms such as Android and iOS with apps developed by members for versions of Android 4.2.2 and iOS 8.1 and above.\n\nThe primary business uses of UPI are to allow a personal mobile as the primary device for all payments, including person to person, person to entity, and entity to person. Using a personal mobile an individual can \u2018Pay\u2019 someone (push) as well as \u2018Collect\u2019 from\nsomeone (pull). In addition, the ability to pay and collect using \u2018UPI IDs\u2019 that are \u2018aliases\u2019 to the VPA. The goal is to make  payments by providing an address without having to ever provide account details or credentials on third party applications or websites.\nAlso, sending \u2018collect\u2019 requests to others (person to person or entity to person) with a\u2018pay by\u2019 date, which allows customers to pay at a later date without blocking the money in the account. UPI also allows for pre-authorizing multiple recurring payments (utilities, school fees, subscriptions, etc.) with a one-time secure authentication and rule-based access, similar to ECS. UPI autopay allows customers to set recurring payments for their UPI transactions. Recurring payments up to Indian Rupees 2000 can be set at the frequency desired.\n\nThis makes payments using UPI a fully interoperable system across all PSPs without having silos and closed systems with one-click two-factor authentication, using a personal\nphone, and without any acquiring devices or physical tokens.\n\nIn March 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the linkage of UPI and Singapore\u2019s PayNow. Remittances from Singapore to India were on track to breach the $100 billion mark in 2023, making it the fourth highest remitting nation to India, accounting for 5.7% of all inbound remittances. Integrating PayNow and UPI will likely reduce charges and the time taken for such transactions.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.

{"topic": "general_qa", "instruction": "Why are all the planets and moons round in shape? What makes them round? Does there exist another shape?", "input": "", "output": "Not all planets and moons are round. There is some variety in their shapes depending on their masses, and curiously looking worlds might even exist, unlike anything we know from our system.\n\nEverything within a planet or a moon is under the influence of gravity in such a way that bits of it would move to the center if they could. Under ideal conditions, it would acquire a spherical shape. For objects made of something other than liquids, it varies at what point they become round. It is generally assumed that they mostly become spheres around 400 kilometers/248 miles in diameter when made from icy material commonly found in our Solar System. Still, if something is made from something more rigid, it needs to be larger in diameter than that - around 750 km/466 miles. At a sufficient mass, even rock becomes fluid-like. The moon of Mars Deimos is only 12.6 km/7.8 miles across and is not spherical, and there are many other small moons of other planets that don\u2019t have a round shape.\n\nThis, however, is not all. Astronomical objects spin, giving them the flattened shape of a sphere the faster their rotation if they are massive enough. On top of it, they can have moons. This causes a bulge to form at the position of their orbiting body around them. In the case of Earth, our Moon causes tides via this process. Also, our Sun gives our planet tides. Elsewhere in the Universe, there could be planets with massive moons or two similarly massive planets, called double planets, orbiting their common center of mass, the barycenter, at a close distance, which can cause even stronger bulging. Their shape would be affected this way more visibly.\n\nFinally, a bizarre, toroidal planet, shown above, can be stable from what we know from physics, at least for a while. As I mentioned earlier, even rigid rock behaves like a fluid at large masses. An adequate rotation speed can counterbalance the strength of gravity with centrifugal acceleration, and a torus-shaped planet could exist. A possible scenario for such a world to come to be would be if two sufficiently fast rotating planets collided and formed a doughnut of vaporized rock, a so-called synestia.\n\nWe currently think that the events that would lead to the formation of a world of this shape are so unlikely that there might not be a single toroidal planet in the Visible Universe, but we were quite a few times surprised by what we discovered during our exploration of Cosmos. Perhaps we will even find a doughnut shape world one day.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
